# JS GO

## Getting Started

```
npm start
```

Visit `https://localhost:8080`.

Note: Must be visited on `httpS`, otherwise prompting for camera access will
silently fail.

Point your mobile device to the IP of your machine to view the AR system there.
The code will try to automatically detect the rear-facing camera.
